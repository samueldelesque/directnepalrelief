			<p>Nepal Earthquake Relief Update: We received a shipment of 1700 lbs of food from our friends in India today. Thank you to Jet Airways and Sweta Gurung’s connections for the free shipping. We fed the entire community at the Teaching Hospital tonight. Without a hospital cafeteria, families visiting patients and patients themselves were grateful for Indian made parathas (pancakes) made fresh in Mumbai this morning. We still have 400kg or so to distribute tomorrow. With an estimated 15,000 parathas we should be able to feed at least 3,000 people.</p>

			<p>Our primary objective remains getting supplies to the village of Chaukati as quickly as possible. Supplies in Kathmandu are critically low. The city is virtually sold out of tarps and means of water purification. We have some tarps flying in tomorrow. (Thank you Kristin Brudevold!) and 200 water filters being made by our friends at ECCA. Still, no one on the ground here is able to procure the supplies they need in the scale they are needed. </p>

			<p>The challenges to providing the relief needed are frustrating. We have a truck of supplies on the Indian border with Nepal which so far has been unable to get permission to enter the country, and we spent 5 hours in the airport trying to clear our cargo through customs today without paying tax on it. We found numerous aid workers stranded at the airport all day unable to clear customs. The Nepali government seems to be using the crisis to its own advantage, reportedly now requiring all aid comes through a “Minister’s Fund”. Larger aid organizations are likely to have to pay heavy customs charges on their cargo. Now 5 days after the earthquake, basic supplies for shelter and sanitation still have not arrived in a quantity to be made available to the public. Many areas have still not seen any relief work reach them. Chaukati remains one of them.</p>

			<p>Tomorrow we hope to be able to gather enough supplies for our first shipment to Chaukati. I plan to travel there the day after tomorrow with a small group of doctors and volunteers to deliver a basic first response and to assess the needs of the community. We hope to have a second larger shipment coming a few days after that once more cargo is flown in from India.</p>

			<p>Please continue to support relief efforts in Nepal.</p>
